Finds an optimal layout for TNT cannon shots.

In case you don't know what to do with the cmd.mcfunction file:

1. Navigate to .minecraft/saves/[WORLD]/datapacks.
2. Create and enter folder [DATAPACK NAME].
3. Create text file pack.mcmeta with the content {"pack":{"pack_format":6,"description":"A descriptive description."}}.
4. Create and enter folder data.
5. Create and enter folder [NAMESPACE].
6. Create and enter folder functions.
7. Drag the cmd.mcfunction file here.
8. While in-game and playing on the [WORLD] save, run the command /reload.
9. Run the command /function [NAMESPACE]:cmd

Any time you generate a new cmd.mcfunction file, you only need to repeat steps 7, 8, and 9.
